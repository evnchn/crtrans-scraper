# crtrans-scraper
Scrapes HKUST Credit Transfer Database (https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/useful-tools/credit-transfer/database-institution)

Currently a proof-of-concept with a crude way for entry filtration, but at least it is local, which enables more processing to be done if necessary. 

## Usage

- Install relevant dependencies
- Run `scrape_data.py`
  - Be patient and wait for HKUST server as it does its thing
- Edit `analyze_data.py` for your own needs and run it
